The Playdate SDK is available for x86_64 Linux and macOS. The Windows SDK ships as an installer, which this plugin does not support.

# Install

The following covers how to install Playdate with asdf.

## Plugin

First, install the plugin with:

```shell
asdf plugin add playdate https://github.com/RobLoach/asdf-playdate.git
```

## Playdate

Once the plugin is installed, you can install a version of the Playdate SDK:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all playdate

# Install specific version
asdf install playdate latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global playdate latest

# Now playdate commands are available
pdc --version
PlaydateSimulator --help
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.

## PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH
